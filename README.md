# img_labeler
Windows C# based program used for easily drawing vectors over an image and saving the vector points to a standard JSON or XML format.
Useful for object classification within images.

To use,
drag and drop an image onto the form. You can load additional images by dropping more than one image, or dropping more images later.
Press Ctrl+N to create a vector.
Left click on the image to add new points, right click on points you wish to remove.

Once you've created all the vectors you want, click File->Save->Vectors and export the vectors to a file format of your choosing.

If you wish to work on and save multiple image classifications, you can load multiple images and classify objects within each, and then export the classification data for all images. You can switch between each image by clicking View -> Image List, and then selecting the image you wish to work with from the list.
